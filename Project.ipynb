    "\n",
    "* Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.\n",
    "* Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance\n",
    "* Present a statistical analysis of the dataset\n",
    "* Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.\n",
    "* Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature\n",
    "* Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended – using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints\n",
    "* Document your work in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "* As a suggestion, you could use Pandas, Seaborn, SKLearn, etc. to perform your analysis. \n",
