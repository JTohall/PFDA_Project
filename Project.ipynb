    "Breast cancer occurs in every single country of the world in women at any postpubescent age but with increasing rates in later life. <br/>\n",
    "The World Health Organisation states that in 2020 there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer, and 685,000 deaths globally, making breast cancer the most common cancer in women. One in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer in a lifetime, fortunately, this rate is decreasing with awareness but still many women are not aware of the early signs or symptoms.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer arises in the lining cells of the ducts or lobules in the glandular tissue of the breast. Initially, the cancerous growth is confined to the duct or lobule, where it generally causes no symptoms and has minimal potential for spread. However over time and without any treatment, these stage 1 cancers may progress and invade the surrounding breast tissue, developing into an invastive breast cancer which will then spread to the nearby lymph nodes or to other organs in the body, this is also known as distant metastasis. If a woman dies from breast cancer, it is because of widespread metastasis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer treatment can be highly effective, especially when the disease is identified early. Treatment of breast cancer often consists of a combination of surgical removal, radiation therapy and medication (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and/or targeted biological therapy) to treat the microscopic cancer that has spread from the breast tumor through the blood. Such treatment, which can prevent cancer growth and spread, thereby saves lives.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For this project, I will analyse the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. The dataset was developed in 1995 by researchers at the University of Wisconsin, and includes the measurements from digitized images of fine-needle aspirate of a breast mass. A fine-needle aspirate is a type of biopsy performed using a small needle to obtain samples of tissue and fluid from solid or cystic breast lesions. It is one of the many different modalities for diagnosing breast masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breast cancer dataset includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features. One feature is an identification number, another is the cancer diagnosis and 30 are numeric-valued laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as \"M\" to indicate malignant or \"B\" to indicate benign.\n",

    "This study deals with multidimensional data analysis, precisely cluster analysis applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. This paper proved how both, data visualization and cluster analysis of a dataset, can be achieved by using the Kohonen model of self organizing artificial neural networks and also how the results of this analysis can be used to compare the performances of classification processes.<br/>\n",
    "Cluster analysis is a method of exploratory data analysis that aims at partitioning a set of data items into groups, based on a measure of distance (or dissimilarity). The groups are called clusters and their number may be pre-assigned or determined by the algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 342 cases used in this study as a testing subset, the linear distance based classifier accuracy was 95.32%, i.e. 326 patterns were correctly classified. It was also found that other classifiers, employing more sophisticated decision techniques (such as fuzzy rules extraction, hybrid systems rule extraction, Bayesian networks) were reporting comparable accuracies in their classifications when analyzing the same dataset. \n",

    "They also concluded that the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset should not be used as a benchmark for classification algorithms, since any linear distance classifier will probably perform with an accuracy of over 90% and the non-linear classifiers' accuracies will not show notable differences as these differences will derive only from the sparse, potentially erroneous, remaining non-linearity present in the data.\n",

So, we extracted the features from data by removing the attributes one by one and check out the performance to know the effectiveness of classifier then got to a point that “Single Epithelial Cell Size” have less impact in dataset have negative effect on accuracy. By removing this we get better accuracy with better results with other parameters also.\n",

The study uses the Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer Data Set for classifying breast cancer recurrences on four different configurations: a) only scaling applied, b) scaling with PCA, c) scaling with PCA and oversampling of minority class, and d) only with selected features.\n",

    "Naive Bayes performed poorly especially in the scaling with PCA configuration, however, when one of the many features that have high correlations with each other were retained, Naïve Bayed performance improved.
