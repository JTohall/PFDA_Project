# PFDA_Project
Programming for Data Analysis Assessment 

---

### Problem Statement
<br/>
This project will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The following list presents the requirements of the project:
<br/>

- Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.<br/>
- Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance<br/>
- Present a statistical analysis of the dataset<br/>
- Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.<br/>
- Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature<br/>
- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints<br/>
- Document your work in a Jupyter notebook.<br/>
- As a suggestion, you could use Pandas, Seaborn, SKLearn, etc. to perform your analysis.<br/>
- Please use GitHub to demonstrate research, progress and consistency.<br/>
